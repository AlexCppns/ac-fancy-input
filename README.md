# ac-fancy-input

(WARNING: Still in Alpha development)

Fancy input module for angularJS.
Inspired from Jquery library: https://github.com/yairEO/fancyInput

## Features:

- Animated placeholder typing.
- Text with mixed colors inside input.
- Custom nested suggestions with template support.

## Limitations

The input data object is a singleton for now.
You cannot have multiple instances of the input directive on the same page without having unwanted effects.

## Basic Usage

For now see the example folder

## Dependencies

This requires angular version 1.2.9, later versions were not tested and earlier version will likely not work.
